A fundamental tenet of ``trafaret`` is that the solution to a programming task
usually adheres to one of a set of possible "templates".

Using ``trafaret`` effectively requires you to be attentive: teachers readily
undermine the creativity of their students, and pose overly liberal programming
tasks, having an infeasible set of solutions. Despite these formal
shortcomings, ``trafaret`` can help yield more uniform solutions, and can help
students get started.

``trafaret`` should not be used as the sole, or absolute measure of in-how-far
a solution solves the given task.

Templates
---------

When it comes to programming, variations in the following are readily stripped:

* Whitespace
* Comments
* Naming (up to alpha equivalence)
* Order of certain groups of tokens (e.g., the order of functions in a module)
